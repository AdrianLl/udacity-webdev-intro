Your response goes here!

1. What new skills have you learned?
  The basics needed to create html pages. Some useful elements for formatting and organization on a page. Overall learning how the browser interprets formatting commands.
2. What has been easy?
  Overall the tasks have been somewhat easy to complete. They were simple enough and to the point.
3. What has been difficult?
  Some of the questions or assingments need better wording, they can be confusing and not very easy to understand on the first read.
4. How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  Documentation seems to be key, every piece of code has a well documented page explaining exactly what each element can and cannot do. Being able to ask the right question for the right problem is key.
